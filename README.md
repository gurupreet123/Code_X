Smart Parking System

Problem Statement: 
Parking congestion is a major challenge in urban areas, leading to wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. Traditional parking systems lack real-time visibility into available spaces, resulting in inefficiencies and frustration for drivers.
The objective of this project is to design an IoT-based Smart Parking System that detects and displays available parking slots in real-time. The system will use sensors (such as ultrasonic, infrared, or RFID) to monitor occupancy and transmit data to a cloud-based platform. This data will be accessible via a mobile application and LED indicators at the parking lot entrance.
